/*! \mainpage spl : Stream Processing Library
* This library provides a set of base classes for process, storage, and parameters object.
*
* \section spl_overview Overview
*
* The spl_storage class is an abstract base class for 
* derived storage classes that may store any type of data.  The spl_process class
* is an abstract base class for derived process classes that execute various algorithms
* Thus, a spl_storage class is a wrapper around your data structures while a
* spl_process is a wrapper around your algorithm.  Additional parameters to a
* process are managed by the spl_parameters class.
